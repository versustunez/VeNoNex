/*
 * this file holds function that read some presets
 * in the current Theme class
 * so we doesn't have lot's of classes that only save some hex codes... and make the coding harder
 * also good on this is that the user can slightly change the preset m_theme and doesn't have to make all of them himself
 *
 * maybe i want a double m_look and feel... that's make it easier to implement different knob styles, slider styles and co
